Nothing to worry about, but it will bring two types of electron repulsions, the coulomb repulsions that we already know but also the fermionic ones. Stay tuned.\n",

In this case, this method tell us that any function that we try for our Hamiltonian has an expectation value of the energy that is an upper bound to the ground state energy of the system. We could just do some trial-and-error, put any function in the Hamiltonian and see which one gives us the lowest value.
