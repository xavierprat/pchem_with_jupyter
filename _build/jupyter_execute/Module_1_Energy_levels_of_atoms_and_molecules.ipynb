    "# Module 1: Energy levels of atoms and molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "This module introduces some fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics focusing on the different quantized energy levels in atoms and molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than a systematic development of Quantum theory it covers the analytical simple systems that can later on explain translational, electronic, vibrational, and rotational levels that are needed for statistical thermodynamics in the next module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note for those who learned quantum mechanics elsewhere: we will focus on the results of quantum theory applied to atomic and molecular systems rather than the mathematical development. For example, there is no mention of the Hilbert space, the orthogonalization of a base, commuting operators, wavefunction conjugates...etc\n",
